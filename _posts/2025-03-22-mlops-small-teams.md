## Intro

Machine learning (ML) is no longer a niche capability â€“ it's becoming a core part of modern business strategies. But taking ML models from development to production is a huge leap, especially without solid MLOps practices in place.

For small teams â€“ typically 1 to 3 data scientists â€“ it's essential to start with a lightweight, scalable setup that enables rapid experimentation while maintaining version control, automation, and reproducibility.

In this first part of the series, we'll explore how small ML teams can set up an effective MLOps workflow in the cloud using a minimal, yet powerful, architecture.

---

## 1. The Problem with Manual ML Workflows

- Code is stuck in Jupyter notebooks.  
- Manual retraining eats up valuable time.  
- No version control or automation.  
- Lack of monitoring leads to model drift going unnoticed.

---

## 2. The MLOps Goals for Small Teams

- Improve collaboration and reproducibility  
- Automate training and deployment workflows  
- Add version control for code, environments, and models  
- Begin monitoring for model performance drift

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

**Key Components:**

- **Cloud ML Dev Environment** (e.g., JupyterHub, SageMaker Studio): For collaborative model development and experimentation.  
- **Git-based Version Control** (e.g., GitHub): For code collaboration, versioning, and triggering pipelines.  
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: For managing dataset versions alongside code in a reproducible way.  
- **Cloud Object Storage** (e.g., S3): For storing datasets and model artifacts.  
- **Container Registry** (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry): For storing versioned training and inference environments.  
- **Pipeline Orchestrator** (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines, Airflow): For automating data processing, model training, and evaluation workflows.  
- **Model Registry & Experiment Tracking** (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases): For managing model versions and experiment metadata.  
- **Event-Driven Deployment Functions** (e.g., AWS Lambda): For triggering automated deployments of validated models.  
- **ML Production Environment** (e.g., SageMaker Endpoints, Kubernetes Clusters): For scalable model hosting and serving.  
- **Monitoring & Logging Stack** (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack): For performance tracking, drift detection, and observability.  
- **API Gateway**: For exposing model inference endpoints to users securely.

## 4. Deployment Strategy

- **Event-driven model deployment**: New models registered in MLflow or Weights & Biases trigger automated workflows using AWS Lambda.  
- **Targeted deployment environments**: Models are deployed to SageMaker, Kubernetes, or custom compute instances.  
- **Canary deployments**: New versions are tested in parallel using champion-challenger patterns.  
- **Auto-scaling endpoints**: Infrastructure is configured to scale automatically based on demand.  
- **Monitoring integration**: Prometheus and ELK Stack are used to track performance and detect drift.

## 5. Benefits of This Setup

- Lightweight and easy to manage  
- Cloud-agnostic and flexible  
- Encourages good MLOps habits early on  
- Easily extendable as your team grows

## 6. What's Next?

This setup provides small teams with a solid foundation to develop, deploy, and monitor ML models efficiently in the cloud.

But as your team scales, your MLOps stack must evolve to support more users, models, and complexity.
